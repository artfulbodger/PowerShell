## PowerShell Profiles

I use different settings for each of my PowerShell clients.

* PowerShell Profiles
  * PowerShell Console (Microsoft.Powershell_profile)
  * PowerShell ISE (Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile)
  * VSCode Integrated Console (Microsoft.VSCode_profile)

## IDE User Settings

My Settings file VSCode.  This settings file contains my configuration for vscode, setting it up much like the ISE. I also have included some of the vscode icons settings.
